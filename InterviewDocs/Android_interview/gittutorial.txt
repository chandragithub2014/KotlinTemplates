GIT:
Git is distributed version control system
Distributed means:
Every one will have their own copy.
Local Repository is mainatained with every one.



Git commands:
(1) git config --global help.autocorrect 1    (where 1 is the milliseconds GIT waits to perform autocorrect)
              Auto corrects Git command
(2) git status : Gives status of the repository    (git statse : Also gives status of repository help.autocorrect is set to 1 as above)
   Example:
        E:\KotlinTemplateWorks>git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean


(3)To show colors in order to show git info, we use the below command:
      git config --global color.ui auto

(4) To fetch the config information of the repository:
    E:\KotlinTemplateWorks>type .git\config

Local Git Repository:
(5) Suppose we have an empty directory and we have to turn into local git repository:
Command:
  E:\GitTutorial>git init
(6) To add a new file to local repository:
 E:\GitTutorial>echo "Hello,GIT" > README.txt

(7)E:\GitTutorial>git add README.txt

E:\GitTutorial>git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   README.txt


(8)To commit the file:
   git commit


(9) To look history of commits
    git log

(10) To add modified files:
      git add -u
(11) To add commit message inline:
         E:\GitTutorial>git commit -m "Updated README.txt"
(12) use git diff command : to find difference between 2 commits

      Example:
         E:\GitTutorial>git diff e00f..6da21
diff --git a/README.txt b/README.txt
index 3ebd639..c8d61db 100644
--- a/README.txt
+++ b/README.txt
@@ -1,2 +1 @@
 "Hello,GIT"
-First update
 
Where:e00f..6da21 are commits numbers

(13) Easier way to use git diff command using Head rather than commit SHAH numbers
     The latst commit is known as HEAD
     To go from one commit back to HEAD using tilt commit
      git diff HEAD~1.. HEAD


(14) To add all untracked files:(Suppose u created 2 news files namely file1.txt , file2.txt in ur local repository)
     E:\GitTutorial>git add -A

(15) To delete a file from directory
     del 
      E:\GitTutorial>del file2.txt

(16) E:\GitTutorial>git status     (After removing file)
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        deleted:    file2.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


(17) Once deleted we have to add the update to the GIT local repository
     add -u
       E:\GitTutorial>git add -u

(18)To rename a file
      E:\GitTutorial>rename file3.txt  newfile3.txt



(19) Undoing the changes .
     suppose u removed some content in your file and saved. U want to again get the previous content .
     Then use checkout command
  E:\GitTutorial>git checkout README.txt


(20) To reset working copy back to HEAD
      Suppose u modified some contents in a file and removed another file. U want to get back all the previous content of modified file and recover deleted file
      use Reset command
      E:\GitTutorial>git reset --hard

(21)Cleaning the working copy.
 Suppose u added some unnecessary files say temp1.txt,temp2.txt
use 
git clean -n

git clean -f

Example:
E:\GitTutorial>git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        temp1.txt
        temp2.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

E:\GitTutorial>git clean -n
Would remove temp1.txt
Would remove temp2.txt

E:\GitTutorial>git clean -f
Removing temp1.txt
Removing temp2.txt

E:\GitTutorial>git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

       

(22) Ignoring files to be committed to repository. Suppose we have some files that r not necessary to be committed to repository we need to ignore them.
     Create gitignore text file and write the directories or the files that needs to ignored as below:
 
     E:\GitTutorial>notepad .gitignore

E:\GitTutorial>git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        .gitignore
        logs/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

E:\GitTutorial>notepad .gitignore

E:\GitTutorial>notepad .gitignore

E:\GitTutorial>git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        .gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

E:\GitTutorial>
