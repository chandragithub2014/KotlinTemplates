What is Kotlin:
  - Kotlin is open source Programming language like Java,Java Script.
  - Its high level statically typed language that combines funtional and       technical part in same place.
  - It runs on JVM

Advantage:
Easy Language:
Kotlin is functional language and it is very easy to learn.
The syntax is pretty similar to Java and it easy to remember.
Kotlin is expressive which makes code more readable and understandable.

Consise:
Kotlin reduces lot of boiler plate code used in other programming languages.

Runtime and performance:
Better performance and small run time.

Interoperability:
Kotlin can buld interoperability application in a less complex manner.
We can parts of our code in Java and parts of our code in kotlin as well.


Brand New :
Kotlin is a brand new language. Its not replacement to Java, though it is developed over JVM. Its accepted as first official language of Android developement.


Kotlin Architecture:
Kotlin files have extension as .kt.
The Kotlin compiler converts kotlin class file to byte code  that can be run on JVM. 
Its similar to Java compiler that converts .class file to byte code to be run on JVM.
